Description: `sunsynkr` helps you to acquire information about Sunsynk 
    photovoltaic systems from their API. If you have a Sunsynk inverter and an 
    account to view and manage it on SunsynkConnect, you should be able to use 
    this package to retrieve information about your plant. Note that this 
    package is unofficial and is in no way associated with Sunsynk. It may stop 
    working (or return misleading outputs) at any time and without warning.
